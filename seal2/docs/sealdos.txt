*********************************************************************
SEALDOS.S2A is a program that lets you run DOS application under
SEAL. It unloads most of SEAL's drivers (keyboard, mouse, sound,
etc) in case a DOS application wants to use them. Without removing
the keyboard driver, you cannot type anything in a DOS program,
for example. It then finds the application's path and chdirs to it,
then starts the program. When the program terminates, it displays
a short message then switches back to SEAL after reloading the
drivers.

In some cases, the system may freeze when you return to SEAL,
depending what applications you have run. (This hasn't happened much
with my latest builds). I AM NOT REPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES INCURRED
AS THE RESULT OF USING THIS PROGRAM. This isn't a very nice program
in some ways - it's a bit of a hack, but it works (most of the time).
