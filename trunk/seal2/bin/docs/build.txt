BUILDING SEAL
=============

To build SEAL, you need the following:

- DJGPP 2.03 (with gcc 2.95.3 or a similar version)
  http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/

  SEAL does not currently build with gcc 3.x.

- Allegro 4.0.1 or better
  http://alleg.sourceforge.net/

  If using a different version, you MUST download AllegTTF and rebuild it,
  otherwise SEAL will crash on startup. You can get AllegTTF from
  http://huizen.dds.nl/~deleveld/allegttf.htm. Also, you must recreate the
  src/allegro.exp file. Use the GENEXP tool in the genexp directory to do
  this. Copy allegro/lib/mingw32/allegro.def to the genexp directory, then
  run GENEXP.EXE. Finally, copy the generated allegro.exp to src/allegro.exp.

To build SEAL, change directory into your SEAL root directory, and type
make. This will build the XDL creation tools (dlxgen.exe, dlxinsd.exe and
dlxmake.exe), and then will build the SEAL kernel (bin/seal.exe). Finally,
the SEAL applications and libraries (*.S2A and *.XDL) will be built.

TO BUILD A SEAL APPLICATION
===========================

To build a SEAL application, do the following:

1. Compile the source code with the following command:

      gcc -Iinclude -c yourapp.c -o yourapp.o

   (where 'include' is the path to your SEAL2\include directory)

   Repeat this for as many source files as you have, with whatever
   parameters you require.

2. Type the following to create an XDL or S2A file:

      dlxgen yourapp.xdl yourapp.o yourapp2.o yourlib.a

   If you want to compress the generated file (recommended), use the following
   command:

      dlxgen -Cyourapp.xdl yourapp.o yourapp2.o yourlib.a

   If you are creating a library which will be called from other applications,
   the recommended extension to use is XDL. If you are creating an application,
   the extension you should use is S2A. There are no technical differences
   between the two though.

3. If you have an Allegro datafile which you wish to append to the XDL file,
   type the following command:

      dlxinsd yourapp.xdl yourapp.dat

See the API documentation available at http://sealsystem.sourceforge.net/ for
information on how to write SEAL applications.

REBUILDING THE REGISTRY
=======================

If, for some reason, you need to rebuild the SEAL registry, do the following:

1. Change directory to the SEAL2\bin directory.

2. Delete REGISTRY.DAT.

3. Type the following command:

      regedit doreg.reg

   This will import the default registry settings back into the registry. You will lose
   any customisations you have made to the SEAL interface.
