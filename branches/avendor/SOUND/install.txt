Documentation:
==============

To make an new documentation "sfa.htm" file from dlxsound.c
you need SET-Editor (http://members.xoom.com/stropea/setedit.html).

SOUND.FRT
SOUND.EPR

are used bei SET-Editor to make the documentation.
You have to open the Project sound.epr in SET-Editor and then read the
SDG documentation!

For more questions email me.

How to compile:
===============

Edit


MSOUND.BAT

and change the paths.
I hope I can make a makefile in the future.

You need libamp for sfamp3.c. Download it @ www.allegro.cc

If you have ideas for the library, please email me!!
